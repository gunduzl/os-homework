# My Custom Command for macOS

Welcome to the README for my custom command in macOS! This command, called `network`, allows you to perform various network-related tasks conveniently.

## Installation

To install the `network` command on your macOS system, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Script**:

   Download the `network.sh` script from this repository.

2. **Navigate to the Script Directory**:

   Open Terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the script.

3. **Make the Script Executable**:

   Run the following command to ensure the script is executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x network.sh
   ```

4. **Move the Script to `/usr/local/bin`**:

   Move the script to the `/usr/local/bin` directory using the following command (you may need to enter your password):

   ```bash
   sudo mv network.sh /usr/local/bin/network
   ```

5. **Verify Installation**:

   You can verify that the command is installed correctly by typing `network` in your terminal and ensuring it executes without errors.

## Usage

Once installed, you can use the `network` command to perform various network-related tasks. Here are some examples:

- `network google.com`: Checks the connectivity to Google's website.
- `network -t 8.8.8.8`: Tests the connection to Google's DNS server.
- `network -s`: Displays information about the current network settings.

For more details on usage and available options, you can refer to the help documentation by typing `network -h` or `network --help`.

## Updating the Command

If you need to update the `network` command in the future, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the updated script.
2. Remove the old script (if necessary) using `sudo rm /usr/local/bin/network`.
3. Move the updated script to `/usr/local/bin` with `sudo mv network.sh /usr/local/bin/network`.
4. Set execution permission with `sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/network`.
